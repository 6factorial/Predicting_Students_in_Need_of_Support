# Math251Project

This project is the culminating experience for the Classification Analysis course from Fall 2023. In this project, I examine the Predict Students' Dropout and Academic Success (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) dataset.

## Subheader

In this project, I used multiple classification machine learning models. Some of these models include an additional model by performing a gridsearch for their hyperparameters. In my final project report, I discussed which models were theoretically best suited for these data. I also discuss the performance metrics available to test the models against, as well as which one is the most pragmatic choice. Lastly, I perform model testing using a subset of the data split from the beginning of the project, to compare the top 3 machine learning models and get a sense for which one is the most competitive.
